//Other stuff to add to the game file that I can only remeber through github so I write it all down at school...
<p>Ok, so I've been thinking, and On realize that game that I am currently working on has some major flaws, I think that the next move I'm going to need to make is to start by changing some major game ideals and designs...
so start by changing the goal of the game a little, you do not want to touch any walls so there will be spikes or something on the bottom top left and right of the screen, you will be balencing your ball, inside the screen...
So new game ideal set, but to further the idea, thi nk about using the diferent colors, as different levels of the balls, for example, if the ball was black it is regular, but if it is purple, then there may be a cool animation changing the color of the paddle, and you as a user will enter a new state allowing nyou to destroyb a few balls and remove them from the game making it easier for a time... 
So maybe this powerup idea is stupid, but overall powerups may make it better
overall spikes, new game ideals, and beutiful color schemes...</p>
